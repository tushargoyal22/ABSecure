# ============================================
#Summary of Changes:
# ============================================
# 1️. **Added Loan ID Validation** – Ensures `loan_id` is a valid ObjectId format.
# 2️.**Refactored ObjectId Handling** – Used `validate_object_id()` for consistency.
# 3️.**Improved Logging** – More detailed logs for better debugging.
# 4️.**Better Exception Handling** – Specific error messages for `InvalidId` cases.
# These changes enhance API stability, clarity, and error handling!   
# ============================================

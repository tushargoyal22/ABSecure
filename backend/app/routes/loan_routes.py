# ============================================
#Summary of Changes:
# ============================================
# 1Ô∏è. **Added Loan ID Validation** ‚Äì Ensures `loan_id` is a valid ObjectId format.
# 2Ô∏è.**Refactored ObjectId Handling** ‚Äì Used `validate_object_id()` for consistency.
# 3Ô∏è.**Improved Logging** ‚Äì More detailed logs for better debugging.
# 4Ô∏è.**Better Exception Handling** ‚Äì Specific error messages for `InvalidId` cases.
# These changes enhance API stability, clarity, and error handling!

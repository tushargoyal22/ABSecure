# ============================================
# üîπ Summary of Changes Made:
# ============================================
# 1Ô∏è. **Added Error Handling** ‚Äì Wrapped database queries and bulk writes in `try-except` blocks to prevent crashes.  
# 2Ô∏è.**Handled Invalid Data** ‚Äì Skipped loans that are missing `RiskScore` or not dictionaries, logging warnings.  
# 3Ô∏è.**Dynamic Risk Categorization** ‚Äì Introduced `bucket_size` for flexible risk grouping instead of hardcoded values.  
# 4Ô∏è.**Optimized MongoDB Queries** ‚Äì Fetched only necessary fields (`_id`, `RiskScore`) for better performance.  
# 5Ô∏è.**Improved Bulk Write Handling** ‚Äì Caught `BulkWriteError` to ensure smooth database operations.
